# YouTube Downloader v2.1
Created by Ian Zhang and Connor Carpenter

This program will download an mp4 file from a YouTube link and convert it. The input can be either a YouTube video link or YouTube playlist link. If a playlist link is inputted, every video in the playlist will be downloaded.

Can optionally download mp3 and ogg (mp4 will be downloaded regardless). Selecting to download mp3 and/or ogg will download that file type for the whole playlist.

A 'YouTubeDownloads' folder will be created to contain all the downloaded files. An HTML file will also be created which contains all the YouTube video names and links, mp4 files, and mp3 and/or ogg files (if selected) for every video.

! FILES OF THE SAME NAME WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
